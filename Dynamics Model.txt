# Possible formulation for heirarchical occupancy to estimate covariate effects on 
# community composition of parasites within hosts.

# Here is the formula for the typical occupancy model with one species and 
# repicated samples:

#model {
#      # Priors:
#      p ~ dunif(0 , 1)
#
#  for (i in 1:M){ # M=number of sites
#      #First estimate occurrence (z=1 or 0):
#      z[i] ~ dbern(psi[i])
#      logit(psi[i]) <- alpha.psi + b1.psi*Xcov[i]
#
#      #Second, estimate and factor in detection probability:
#      mu[i] <- z[i] * p
#      Y[i] <- dbin(mu[i], J[i]) #J is the number of samples per site
#      # Y[i] is the number of sites that had a presence of the the species
#  }
#}

# Two problems: 
# 1. I have multiple parasite species
# 2. I want to predict communities w/in host individuals (which are not replicated),
#    not parasite communities w/in sites
